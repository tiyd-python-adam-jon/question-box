### A Website to Source Answers to Your Burning Questions

* `https://boiling-savannah-6958.herokuapp.com/` homepage on web
* `localhost/` homepage in local deployment

### System Requirements

* You will need to have **Python&nbsp;3** installed on your machine or have access to a Python&nbsp;3 interpreter. See [Python's site](https://www.python.org/) for details.

* Copy this repo to your computer; the below assumes you have kept the default folder name as `urly-bird`.

* You will need to make sure that you have a virtual environment running Python&nbsp;3 in the folder that you made in the above step. [See this site for details if you're not familiar.](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/) **Complete this step before attempting the below.**

* Using your favorite command line program (e.g., Terminal on Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X), install the requirements file in your virtual environment: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

* **To create some fake data**, you will need to run some shell commands. Navigate to the `urly-bird/urlybird` folder and confirm that you see the `manage.py` file. Then run the following lines **in order**. (Note that creating the clickstodb takes ~40 minutes on a 2015 MacBookPro.)
```
$ python manage.py migrate
$ python manage.py userstodb
$ python manage.py wormstodb
$ python manage.py clickstodb
$ python manage.py updatenumclicks
```

* **Running the site** requires more command line. Navigate to `urly-bird/urlybird` and enter `python manage.py runserver` This will take over the current command-line program's window until you stop the server. Kill the process by pressing `Ctrl+C` or quitting the command-line program entirely.

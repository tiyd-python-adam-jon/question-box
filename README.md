### A Website to Source Answers to Your Burning Questions

* Website location: **`https://boiling-savannah-6958.herokuapp.com/`**
* Local deployment location: `localhost:[PORT]/` where `[PORT]` is usually `5000` for heroku local and `8000` for Django

## About This Site

### Homepage / All Questions
Located at `host/` and also `host/questions/`, where `host` is the location of the server (usually `localhost:8000` if using Django's `runserver`; `https://boiling-savannah-6958.herokuapp.com/` if accessing on the web). Shows all questions on the site, arranged to show newest questions at the top.

### Question Pages
Located at `host/questions/[question_id]/`, where [question_id] is the numerical id of a question. Shows the question, all provided answers, and an answer form to submit your own answer.

### To Ask or Answer, You Must Be Logged In
There are benefits of creating an account beyond being able to ask and answer questionsâ€”as you interact with the site, you will accrue points for your actions:
 * Asking a question gives you 5 points
 * If your answer is upvoted, you will get 10 points
 * If your answer is downvoted, you will lose 5 points
 * If you downvote another's answer, you will lose 1 point (to discourage trolling)

### Question Form
Located at `host/questions/form`. This is where you post new questions for people to answer.

### Login, Logout, Registration
Located in the navbar at the top of every page; login and registration links show only if not already logged in; logout shows only if logged in.


<!--
### Profile Pages
Located at `host/profiles/[profile_id]`, where `profile_id` is the numerical id of the profile. These are more easily accessed through the interface by clicking on a person's name or, for logged in users, view their own page by clicking on their name on the navbar.

### System Requirements

* To run locally, you will need to have **Python&nbsp;3** installed on your machine. See [Python's site](https://www.python.org/) for details.

* Clone this repo onto your computer; the below assumes you have kept the default folder name as `question-box`.

* You will need to make sure that you have a virtual environment running Python&nbsp;3 in the folder that you made in the above step. [See this site for details if you're not familiar.](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/) **Complete this step before attempting the below.**

* Using your favorite command line program (e.g., Terminal on Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X), install the requirements file in your virtual environment: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

* This app is set up to run on PostgreSQL. It is set it up to have a local (development) database named `questionbox` with a user of `questionbox` and a password of `password`. The database name, user, and password can all be configured to your preferences in the `question-box/questionbox/questionbox/settings.py` file. If you do not have PostgreSQL on your machine, [follow these instructions](https://github.com/tiyd-python-2015-08/course-resources/blob/master/week7/PostgreSQL-and-Django.md).

* **Running the site with Django** requires more command line. Navigate to `question-box/questionbox` and enter `python manage.py runserver` This will take over the current command-line program's window until you stop the server. Kill the process by pressing `Ctrl+C` or quitting the command-line program entirely.

* **Running the site with your own heroku local/web** requires that you have your machine set up with [heroku and heroku toolbelt](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python#set-up) and [create a heroku account](https://signup.heroku.com/).
 * Once you have these installed and have a heroku account, navigate to the `question-box` directory and run the following commands:
 ```
 $ heroku create
 $ heroku config:set DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=questionbox.heroku_settings
 $ heroku config:set PYTHONPATH=questionbox
 $ heroku config:set SECRET_KEY=`python -c 'import random; print("".join([random.choice("abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789") for i in range(50)]))'`
 ```

 * Now, create a new file in the `question-box` directory called `.env` with the following contents where `[your_secret_key]` is replaced with the secret key used in your own heroku server from the previous step:
 ```
 DATABASE_URL=postgres:///questionbox
 DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=questionbox.heroku_settings
 PYTHONPATH=questionbox
 SECRET_KEY=[your_secret_key]
 ```

 * Next, navigate to the `question-box` directory and run the following commands to first, collect the static files (e.g., css files), and then deploy heroku locally (usually located at `localhost:5000`). Again, this will take over the current command-line program's window until you stop the server. Kill the process by pressing `Ctrl+C` or quitting the command-line program entirely.
 ```
 $ python questionbox/manage.py collectstatic
 $ heroku local web
 ```

 * Once this is working, you can deploy and then view online by running the following:
 ```
 $ git push heroku master
 $ heroku ps:scale web=1
 $ heroku run questionbox/manage.py migrate
 $ heroku open
 ```
